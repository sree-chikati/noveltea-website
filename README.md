## About this Project
Noveltea is created to bring together readers to one place in which they can read their favorite books, join fandoms, and even share their expereince with the community.
<br>
The website requires that users signup/login and stores the autheticated information in an SQLite. Once signed in, the user is taken to their profile page through which they have the option to also search for books. 
The book search utilizes Google Books API to allow users to perform searches to find their favorite books.
